          Hey there! I'm <strong>Akiko Luka</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className={pStyle}>
          I'm currently studying to become a Full-Stack Web Developer at DCI
          Digital Career Institute.
        </p>
        <p className={pStyle}>
          Originally from <strong>Japan</strong> and now living in{" "}
          <strong>Berlin</strong>, I'm all about ramen, sushi, anime, and
          photography â€“ which are common among many Japanese individuals..
        </p>
        <p className={pStyle}>
          Being a hard working individual with great attention and focus to
          details are attributes that I identify myself with, which is probably
          part of my culture such as animes, taking pictures and smiling.
        </p>
        <p className={pStyle}>
          Back in 2012, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but
          life had other plans, and I didn't end up in the tech world right
          away. Now, with a fresh start in Germany, I'm ready to dive back into
          the industry. My goal? To find an amazing team where I can grow,
          learn, and make some digital magic happen.
