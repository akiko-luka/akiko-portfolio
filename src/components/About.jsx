            Hey there! I'm <strong>Akiko Luka</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            A <strong>Full-Stack Web Developer</strong>
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            Originally from <strong>Japan</strong> and now living in{" "}
            <strong>Berlin</strong>, I'm all about ramen, sushi, anime, and
            photography â€“ which are common among many Japanese individuals.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            In 2012, I earned a Bachelor's degree in{" "}
            <strong>Computer Science</strong>, but life took me in a different
            direction, leading me to gain experience in{" "}
            <strong>Customer Service</strong> through various customer-oriented
            roles. This experience has honed my ability to provide innovative,
            customized solutions for customers and taught me the importance of
            prioritizing customer interests, a value deeply cherished in Japan.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            Now embarking on a new chapter in Germany, I have recently completed
            an epic journey through the{" "}
            <strong>Full-Stack Web Developement</strong> program at DCI Digital
            Career Institute. I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can
            leverage my unique combination of customer service expertise and
            coding skills to create exceptional web solutions. My goal is to
            thrive in an inspiring environment where I can grow, learn, and
            contribute to creating digital magic.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            I specialize in the MERN stack, utilizing React.js for dynamic
            frontends, Node.js and Express.js for robust backends, and MongoDB
            for flexible data storage solutions.
