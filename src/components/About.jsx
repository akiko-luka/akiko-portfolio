            Hey there! I'm <strong>Akiko Luka</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            A <strong>Full-Stack Web Developer</strong>
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            I'm all about ramen, sushi, anime, and photography â€“ which are

            In 2012, I earned a Bachelor's degree in{" "}
            <strong>Computer Science</strong>, but life took me in a different
            direction, leading me to gain experience in{" "}
            <strong>Customer Service</strong> through various customer-oriented
            roles. This experience has honed my ability to provide innovative,
            customized solutions for customers and taught me the importance of
            prioritizing customer interests, a value deeply cherished in Japan.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            While living in Germany, I embarked on an exciting new chapter by
            completing the <strong>Full-Stack Web Development</strong> program.
            This experience allowed me to combine my technical expertise with a
            customer-focused mindset, enabling me to create meaningful and
            impactful digital solutions. I am eager to join a collaborative team
            where I can grow, learn, and contribute to creating digital magic.
          </p>
          <p className={pStyle}>
            I specialize in the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, crafting dynamic
            frontends with React.js, building robust backends using Node.js and
            Express.js, and implementing flexible data storage solutions with
            MongoDB. With these skills, I am ready to help build innovative web
            applications that make a difference.
