        <p>Hi there! My name is Akiko.</p>
        <p>I'm currently studying to become a full-stack Web Developer at DCI.</p>
        <p>I am from Japan and now living in Berlin, love ramen, sushi and am also into anime and taking pictures such as most Japanese, I guess.</p>
        <p>Being a hard working individual with great attention and focus to details are attributes that I identify myself with, which is probably part of my culture such as animes, taking pictures and smiling.</p>
        <p>In 2012, I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science but didn't end up in my profession. Now, after moving to Germany, I am giving it a new shot and my goal is to join or work in a fantastic group that will help me to keep growing in this exciting industry.</p>
